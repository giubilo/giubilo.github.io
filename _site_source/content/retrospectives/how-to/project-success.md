Introduction
It might be stating the obvious but we begin a project with the view that we are going to successfully deliver the project’s outcomes. Right! In general I guess that is true, except for those stakeholders hoping we don’t finish, don’t deliver, don’t succeed.
Is finishing or delivering, the end-game then? Is that what success is.  How do we know we are at the end? How do we measure the level to which we have achieved the outcomes?
Who Says What Success Is?
What success means, is dependant generally on perspective; that is, who we are measuring success for.  There are generally many stakeholders on a project, all with their own views, sometimes conflicting, on what success is.  Success then is defined by the stakeholder’s personal views, professional views, role they play on the project or in society.  Their views are more than likely affected by the impact the project has on the environment, dictated by things like scale (100,000 people, 10 years) and nature (e.g. construction, software, social change) of the project.
The old saying “the project was brought in on time, on budget and with acceptable quality” is still, in some peoples mind, the measure of project success.  There is much evidence to suggest however, that these are not the only measures of success.

Success as a Function of Time
Projects are unique, transient, almost organic entities.  They have a start, middle and end.  
At the beginning of a project it is important to understand what are the criteria for success and who is measuring success.  This allows the direction of the project to be set and provides a yardstick with which to later evaluate the project.
During the project we monitor success at useful points to ensure there is a reason to continue, to learn from what we have done right so that we can continue to use successful techniques and use points of success to motivate the team.
It is important to end the project with success as generally all stakeholders have begun and continued the project with the thought of success. 
The point in time we are measuring success has an enormous influence on what success is and who measures success.  The team may be interested in time and quality during the project, the sponsor in cost at delivery time and the community might be interested in the impact the project had years after it was delivered.

Maximising Success
Some easy steps to maximise the chances of success;
* Understand the general drivers, pressures, resistance and dynamics of projects
* Learn from past mistakes
* Apply sound management techniques

Understanding Projects
The chances of success can be maximised if you manage the forces on the project effectively.

Turner describes a number of interactions of a project.  Each may have an affect on the other.  Even though most projects by their nature are unique, some of the effects of the interactions may be understood through examining similarities to other projects.  Many of these project integration affects are well documented.

Of all the project dynamics, Attitude is the most important.
The chances of success are substantially diminished unless;
* There is major commitment to making the project a success
* The motivation of everyone working on the project is high
* Attitudes are supportive and positive.

Learning From The Past
There is an enormous amount of generic information about what teams have done in the past to succeed and what pitfalls caused a less than desirable outcome.  The sheer volume of literature and anecdotal evidence to suggest that projects fail is a strong indicator for being concerned about why projects fail.
By looking to the past we can see what worked and what didn’t so that we can learn from past successes and avoid past mistakes.

Cunning Plan: We'll just do it!!

If you fail to plan, then plan to fail.

We never seem to have time to plan our projects, but we always have time to do them twice.

Project Pitfalls
3 Grude describes a number of categories of pitfalls that have been observed on projects.  This is not intended as an exhaustive list but useful as a quick health check for a project;

Establishing the Project  
Pitfalls in the way the project is set up within the parent organisation;
  
* project plans not aligned with business plans,  
* procedures for managing projects are not well defined,  
* priorities are not communicated to parties involved,  
* no shared vision.  


Planning the Project
Pitfalls in the way the work is defined, the time & cost schedules calculated and communicated to the project team;

* project plans developed on a single level,
* using cumbersome tools,
* creativity discouraged,
* unrealistic estimates


Organising & Implementing the Project
Pitfalls in building the project organisation and assigning work to people;

* lack of cooperation,
* resource providers not committed,
* resources not available when required,
* management responsibility not defined,
* poor communication,
* technical vs project management.

Controlling the Project
Pitfalls in monitoring and control;

* purpose of control not understood,
* progress is not monitored against the plan,
* ineffective review meetings,
* responsibility without authority.

Principles of Good Project Management
Project Management, just as any other management stream, has it’s own principles upon which a manager can look to for guidance.  There is a huge body of stored knowledge on the principles and professional certification available for those willing.  These will all arm the manager with an enormous amount of skill and techniques on which to build experience.
In addition to reading through all of the available knowledge and undertaking the available studies a number of simple, practical principles may be relied upon;
 Most large or complex problems become easier if broken down into manageable parts that 	allow them all to be absorbed.  Make use of breakdown structures for any part of the project 	that requires visibility and understanding, such as tasks, people, product, organisation.  By 	breaking then down we can more easily see new information about each piece as it becomes 	evident over time.  This makes it possible to monitor and manage the project elaboration.
 People are the biggest factor in nearly all projects, they need to be adequately motivated, 	organised, committed, directed, skilled and communicated with.  You need to confirm and 	align stakeholder’s success criteria.  Disregard the people factors at your peril.
 Get as many successes as you can.  Organise the team, the schedule & the work so that 	successes happy often.  If each small step is a success it will be easier and more likely that 	the journey will be a success.  Learn from past successes and avoid the causes for past 	failures.
 Continuously carry out health checks and audits.  The old adage, ‘if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ 	doesn’t apply if we don’t know it isn’t broken.  Only by understanding the dynamics and 	symptoms of a project can we steer the ship and take corrective actions.

 Above all else KEEP IT SIMPLE.
