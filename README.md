### organising your digital life

Your family is probably more organised than ours but we generate or collect a ton of stuff, and it's everywhere.

We'd love to be able to:

* store all our stuff forever, regardless of what it is and not worry about losing it because it got deleted, misplaced or was overwritten.  
* save stuff easily without needing to spend ages creating folder structures and labels.  
* find stuff, no matter where it is or where we are, or what it's being used for.  
* be in control of our stuff, but also still be able to get help from others to manage it.  
* be able to safely and easily share stuff and know what its being used for.  

We want a simple access point to the family's entire digital life -- a virtual personal assistant to tie up the loose ends of how we organise our important documents and entertainment.  

The processes and tools to do this aren't new concepts.  Organisations have:  

* Advanced Case Management processes using Business Process and Enterprise Content Management Systems.  
* Application Lifecycle Processes using Integrated Development Environments and Distributed Source Code Control tools.  
* Research processes using Immutable Research Repositories.  

With giubilo, we want to:  

* work out how to make the processes and tools large organisations use to organise stuff, practical for a household.
* learn how to use some open source application lifecycle techniques, tools and technologies.  
* have some fun and pass back what's been learned to the community.

Read the [project page](http://giubilo.org) to see more about:  

* what we think Consumer Content Management is.  
* the motivation for doing this.  
* the idea.  
* what steps are on the roadmap to do this.  

It's still early days so there's not much in the bag yet but we'll get there.
